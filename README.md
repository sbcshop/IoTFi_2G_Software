IoT-Fi is a compact low power IoT enabled device having the capability of GSM modules (SIM868/SIM7600G-H) for providing network connectivity via using sim card and having the power of RP2040 chip. It also consists of an LCD 1.14” display, ESP32-C3, a 3.5mm jack for audio I/p - o/p, SD card and SIM card slot.

## Features:
* ESP-32(C3)
* USB type-C for power-up board and uploading codes in rp2040
* Five user Buttons
* SD card slot for storing data
* On Board RP2040
* Two antenna connectors
* A 3.5mm jack for audio input output
* 1.14 LCD display

## Features of SIM868:

* Small in size quad band (GSM/GPRS + GNSS)
* LCC + LGA form factor with abundant interfaces including UART, USB2.0, GPIO, etc.
* Low power consumption
* Embedded TCP/UDP Protocols
